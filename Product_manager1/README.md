In this assignment, we will add the ability to create a new product on the main page of the app.

1) Create  MERN stack folder structure

2) Create  server, model, controller, routes, and config files for server

3) On the client end ==> Create a form component so that  Product can have a title, price and description.

4) Check in  database that products are being added.
Use Postman to verify that you get a full mongo document (json object including _id, createdAt, updatedAt, etc.) as a response to create route.
