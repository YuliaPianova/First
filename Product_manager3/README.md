1) Add the route localhost:3000/edit/:id that will include an autofilled form to edit a given product.

2) Add a delete button in the List component as well as the detail component that will delete the product from the database

3) After you delete the product from the Detail component, redirect to the main view

4) After you delete the product from the main view, update the DOM so that the product is removed.
