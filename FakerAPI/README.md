In this assignment, we will be using 2 javascript libraries to create a simple API that generates a User and/or Company depending on the route:

Express (Server)
Faker (Fake data generator)

  Create a new project folder "Faker_API" and with your terminal, navigate into your new folder

  Create a package.json file using the "npm init -y" command in your terminal

  install express and faker

  Create a server.js file

  In your server.js file, Import express and faker

  Create 2 functions: createUser, createCompany that return an object with the properties listed above

  Create an api route "/api/users/new" that returns a new user

  Create an api route "/api/companies/new" that returns a new company

  Create an api route "/api/user/company" that returns both a new user and a new company

  Run your server.js file using nodemon

  Using Postman, test your new GET routes
